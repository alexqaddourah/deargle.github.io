See [here](/security-assignments/virtual-machines/#setting-up-virtualbox-and-the-infoset-net-network) for instructions on setting up virtualbox for this class.

<div class='alert alert-info'><strong>Heads up!</strong> Be sure that you have created the <code>infosec-net</code> virtualbox network, as specified at the top of the above link, <i>before</i> importing the vm! It's not the end of the world if you don't, but it does require some extra work.</div>

Next, obtain [My prepared Windows 10 VM]( /security-assignments/virtual-machines/#windows-10 )


	
# Part 1

## Polyalphabetic substitution and Transposition Ciphers 

1.  Using polyalphabetic substitution, with alphabet a–z (no caps) and a space (as the last character of the alphabet), use the private key `security` to encrypt the plaintext message:
     
         send money
	
    To help you, use the following formula:
	
        Encryption: ciphertext = (plaintext + key) mod 27

        Decryption: plaintext = (ciphertext - key) mod 27
	
    Important: Number your alphabet so that it starts with zero, e.g., A = 0.
    
    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the ciphertext when encrypting "send money" with the key "security"?' %}
    
2.	Consider the transposition method discussed in class.  Assume the plaintext is
		
        attack postponed until two am
		
    and the key is `{3421567}`
        
    Create the ciphertext as was demonstrated in class. Pad the message so that there is an even block of characters, meaning that each column will have the same number of characters. One way to do this is to pad the block by repeating the message a character at a time until the block is complete. Show your result.
    
    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the ciphertext when encrypting "attack postponed until two am" with the key {4312567}? (Enter without spaces)' %}

## Frequency analysis

[Download](https://www.cryptool.org/modules/mod_ctdownloads/assets/curversion.php) and install CrypTool 2 (Windows only).

Open CrypTool 2.0. Under Templates, select Cryptanalysis, then Classical, and double-click on Frequency Analysis. Paste the cipher text below into the Text Input box and hit the Play button. This will use CrypTool’s cryptanalysis function, “Frequency Test,” to analyze the following message. The results of the analysis will show up in the box on the right.

**Questions:**

1. Examine the frequency table in the Frequency Test component. What are the four most frequent characters, in descending order? Examine the frequency table chart at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis). What does this suggest the four letters identified correspond to?

    {% include lab_question.html question='According to CrypTool, what are the four most frequent characters?' %}

2. Do the same analysis, but for character pairs (bigrams) or trigrams. You can either open up a new Frequency Test or hit the Stop button and modify the test you’re currently running.  Under the settings tab of the Frequency Test box, you can change the length of n-grams.  Hit Play and then view the Presentation tab for a graphical view of your results.  What are the three most frequent N-grams of length 2 in your analysis? Examine the frequency table chart at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram). What does this suggest the three 2-length N-grams identified correspond to? Also examine N-grams of length 3, and report the likely plaintext identities of the four 3-length N-grams reported (use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram)).

    {% include lab_question.html question='According to CrypTool, what are the three most frequent trigrams?' %}
    
3. Assume that a simple cipher that shifts all characters by a fixed number was used to create the cipertext. Given the above information, what is the key (the shift to go from plaintext to ciphertext)?  Don’t be proud; you can use your fingers to count.   

    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the key of the ciphertext, counting forwards?' %}

4. What is the plaintext?  (Hint: Which cipher shifts all the characters by a fixed number?  It’s listed as one of the Classic Ciphers in this tool, so you can use this tool to perform the decryption.)

    {% include lab_question.html question='What author is quoted in the plaintext?' %}
    
## One-time Pad

Using Cryptool2, decrypt the following ciphertext using the following one-time pads. 
**Note:** Click "New" > "Workspace" to get started. You’ll need to use the XOR function under “Classic Ciphers” to do the encryption. You’ll also need to use the “String Decoder” to decode the string as hexadecimal before passing the stream to the XOR function (see screenshot below).
I like to use the Tools tab on the bottom-left and its search bar to drag components such as XOR and "String Decoder" into my project.

Use the screenshot below to see how to connect the components. Put the ciphertext into one text input box and the one-time pads in the other text input box, one at a time. 
Click-and-drag the component arrow connectors over to an appropriate connector arrow on the next component 
(it may not be the same one as shown in the screenshot -- the CrypTool tooltip guides will help you).

# Part 2

## Hashing

Find a file and hash it with multiple hashing algorithms (e.g., using md5deep.exe, sha1deep.exe, and sha256deep.exe, command-line tools installed on the windows vm).

* You can use "hash-me.txt" on the Windows vm desktop
* Shft+Right-click on the desktop and choose "Open PowerShell window here"
* The command-line tools are available from this prompt, which means you can type their name followed by the filename to get a hash. E.g., "md5deep hash-me.txt"

<div class='alert alert-info'>
<p>If you're not using the lab VM, you can download the command-line tools yourself from <a href='https://github.com/jessek/hashdeep/releases/download/v4.4/md5deep-4.4.zip'>here</a>.
You'll unzip them and then open an command prompt (sorry, I have no idea how to open a command prompt from parallels, let me know if you know how.). Then you can either call the full path to the tools (e.g., c:\path\to\md5deep.exe), or you can
Windows key > "Edit the System environment variables" > "Environment Variables" > select "Path" > "Edit" > "New" > "Browse" > (Browse to the path where you unzipped your md5deep stuff, the folder where the .exe's are). Hit Ok > Ok > Ok (you have to do all three before it applies)
then open a new command prompt / PowerShell window. Voila, you should have the tools avaialble on your path now.</p></div>

**Questions:**

1.	What is the length of each algorithm hash in characters (MD5 sha1, sha256)? How many bits does each hash represent? 

    (hint: how many bits are in one hex digit -- also called a 'nibble'? How many nibbles in the key? Or, How many bits in a byte, and how many bytes in a two-digit hex number like 'FA'? Review [this](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal_numeral_system) if you're still stuck)

    {% include lab_question.html question='How many bits are in an MD5 hash?' %}

Make a copy of your file and open the copy in HxD. (HxD is available on the desktop.) Use the hexeditor to change just a single bit (e.g, change an “A” — 1010 to a B — 1011. Use Windows Calculator in the “Programmer” mode to be sure that your hexcode change represents a change of only one bit.) 
Save the modified file and hash it again. Since you only changed a single bit in a file of billions of bits, you might reason that the hashes would be nearly the same. Are they?

{% include lab_question.html question='If only one bit is changed on a 10 GB file how different will the hash be?' %}
{% include lab_question.html question='Which property of cryptographic hash functions is most related to the previous question?' %}



**Optional:** Use the MD5 function in CrypTool to hash a file. Look at the graphical depiction for how it works.

## Message Sharing

Use AES or another symmetric block cipher to encrypt/decrypt messages exchanged between you and another class member. (You could email encrypted messages to one another, and decrypt using CryptTool. You can copy-paste from the host into your VM if you enable the bidirectional clipboard)
