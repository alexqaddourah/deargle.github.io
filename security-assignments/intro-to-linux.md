title: Intro to Linux

# Complete this very gentle introduction to Linux Terminal

CodeAcademy has a [nice introductory set of lessons](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) that teach the Linux Terminal. You should complete all four free lesson-sets:

1. Navigating the File System
2. Viewing and Changing the File System
3. Redirecting Input and Output
4. Configuring the Environment

If you complete these, you should have a sufficient knowledge of Linux to be able to follow
along with all of the labs for my class.



# Learn a linux text editor

Read [this note on choosing which text editor to learn](/security-assignments/note-on-editors), then learn one (i.e., google 'nano tutorial'). I recommend `nano` for you all.


# Deliverable

You _must use your Kali vm for the following_. Doing so proves both that you got Kali up and running, and that you have baby-step skills with Linux terminal.

* Make a directory called `le-tutorial`
* In that directory, create a file called `i-did-it.txt` with the following contents: `Hello, world!`
* Submit a screenshot showing:
    * The contents of that file (`cat`)
    * A string with your name and uni email, e.g., `echo "David Eargle david.eargle@colorado.edu"`
    * Run the `date` command
    
For example:
